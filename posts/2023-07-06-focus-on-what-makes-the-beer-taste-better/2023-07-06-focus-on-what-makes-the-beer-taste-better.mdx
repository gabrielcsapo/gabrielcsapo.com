Recently I have been binging [the Acquired Podcast](https://www.acquired.fm) and one of the things that stands out is [the Amazon podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3qIWN-ZIPk) that Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal did was a quote from Jeff Bezos:

> “Focus on what your beer tastes better” - Jeff Bezos

For so much of programming we are reverse engineering ideas or things that exist or building derivatives of ideas or things that we want to exist. A lot of the time I have gotten caught up on the "well if I make A, I might as well own the library B since I am already here and need it but don't want to use something that already exists because it is simple". Enough times that is said it becomes ["not invented here"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome.

I have struggled with that in the past and hearing this quote from Jeff Bezos reminds me, it is useful to know all the steps on how to make a thing, but you don't have to own all of the pieces. This is especially true if this is not a core competency. It stood out to me more when I listened to their podcast on [Lockhead Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atMrnp_EVcI) where core competency needs to be established and something you continually refocus on. It is natural to want to own or do more things especially if it is something you depend on, but Lockhead would have not been able to develop the [P-80 Shooting Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-80_Shooting_Star) if they had tried to build all of the pieces. Instead they focused on sourcing quality parts and materials to make their designs possible.
